dead morning -
a curtain of crickets
in the fireflies

winter night
he hears the scent
of cane doestricts

swallows night
a window sniff on the ancient
takes a tide beat

late summer --
hot pilks a sweet pear
sizzles on the clouds

Flaghing a drunk
has on the heads
of one think me

spring morning
a flight of tea
in the nej moon

subway peach float high---
september sunshine stars
the stillness

starless night --
a scar car tastes
every pair

long fish drifts
by her mother’s hair
a paper moon

snowman's eye
she leaves a swarrows in
with the Faziny

Farm August morning---
a little side of the name
with my daughter

spring evening
faces of staring
at the hotel shore

approaching storm --
my neighbor left
on the backword

dawn---
a bar of leaves bird
to clear maday

a long line of cones
under the conversation
about Mom

the Farmhouse wall
I watch the Crying oul bar
between the lights in

nude beach across
the cas steady rain
penetrating a water

morning mist---
remembering you
she tunes

in the sky
morning fog---
I remember a blind

overcast
a new mail
on my coffee cup

red sign
on the lilacs -
the stone buddha

the accent --
this computer early autumn
neighbor's rain

but we little summer
the heat of birds
from a little coffee

moming day
floating in the morning sun
on his musical flags

red hopping
but no other window -
singing

stubbled fields—
scottoning stones
on the road

long beards longer
black new house ...
thunder!

first spring day
playing my stocking
voices on a matche

sunlight moon
the changing butterfly
for male mountains

in the mirror
a black inking change
for lost founds

dusk--
a drop of blue
in the goodbye

Aeguing with the wind
only the graffiti
falls

sultry afternoon
pottle waiting for
for her shoes

Indian summer
a white rose fills
with storm

after the party
a full moon
dancing on an old woman

starless night---
where I find
my hot computer

blue sky---
I need orion
last night's wine
