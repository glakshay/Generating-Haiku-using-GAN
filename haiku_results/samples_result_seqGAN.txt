falling fog -- - + the traffic only grey
november moon -- - + i thoughts of the last blossoms + from a bee 's room
frost - + the last nail + heavy time .
a few home are day , . . . + on the window , the sun , + the empty direction
autumn mist ... + long neglected beer + + the last of light a hair
on my hospital garden -- - + she takes him the earth + has one is the wall
old love letter + the gravedigger latches the edge + a cold highway
a passing cafe + the homeless man + is the autumn light
collecting shells - + the silence beyond the sparrow smaller
winter summer day -- - + the last blossoms , + a crying stone direction
garden workâ€” , + i nothing in the + back to a garbage truck
a rainy day moon - + by the silence beyond the mouth + time for a towel
struggling from + the thin slice in me + even the haiku
new moon -- - + i nothing memories is the main + old gourd
half moon -- - + i walk are as me + thoughts the tunnel
the darkness + house sky- + the desire of snowy egret , + in the old red
waiting for rain + the ferry , the way new + back to the window
autumn fog -- - + the air conditioner + + family is heavy over rose , a bath the old
i long june day , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
day moon - + i i walk at the window , red fog
winter day day -- - + i walk are + in her shadow
the rain + the silence + from the migrant 's last day
half moon -- - + i dreams starts the last + thoughts of day
red sky- + i talk + in the sea
the old silence + the shadows between us + is heavy + terrorists
more rain -- - + i she and me of the last road + old hunting shirt
indian summer - + i and i take ? , + river , red fog
circle against market + a calling of a mosque -- - + in the time
after the fog -- - + i walk to the arc welder + half moon
autumn snow -- - + she takes me on the + well fed
autumn day day -- - + i thoughts on the red -- - + as you show the rain
in the river -- - + the old tears + cold moon
