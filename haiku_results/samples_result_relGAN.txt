in the hospice + the child drowned + papyri in my tea + cicadas and ringtones
spring mist + the tree i take + into the ground + a white branch
heavy rain + the sound of hammering + on the sidewalk + at the pond
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder ! + field of stars
moon gazing + fogging up the window + she teaches her grandchild + on a half moon
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
easter in the taste + of afternoon + and marshmallows
the page-finders + of a fox + its petals fall + my cold night
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
foggy + the child + points on the line + the daffodils nodding + in the wind
-- + my husband starts snoring + again + on the rain
despite the day + a bee egg + on the sidewalk
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the last + changes lit
high autumn + the house comes + out of the wood + a day of the fence
we sip sweet + everything + dripping from the mirror + her silence
in the net + the fisherman finds + a starfish + on the dark
wedding anniversary + does he still the old + in the dark
memorial day + the flowers have long faded + on the last rose
at the moon + the river 's current + dragging stars
grey today + the waves rush + memories
woodsmoke over + listening + to the waning moon
under the sky + the silence + a rain + without blinking
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
a sudden moon + the last ball of + the path home
lonely spring saturday - + the sun sets + the ac of the roses + have become shorter
crescent moon + just one more + for the wind
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce + on his shoulders
hot chocolate + the fallen leaf + half-green , + across the village green
spring breeze + the desire of the + receding
the scent + of the first fallen leaf + on the window + a single leaf on the land + then the sax way
march winds + the tea leaves + with mist + a white butterfly
in the doctor + half a mirror + a a blue mother + and watch
