abandoned farmhouse: a
moth flies out of the water
faucet

cold stethoscope --
I lie to the doctor
about my drinking

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart

waning moon --
a hand-printed sign reads:
"lost dog"

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce

midnight -
the windy silence
of the sickle moon

short night . . .
thoughts of you and
a paper thin moon

afternoon rain
emptying a book
of its words

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses

this cockfight -
the dreams of ancient warriors
still alive

returning swallows ...
she calls me
by my old name

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze

sharp night
a thin plume of smoke
from the fire station

first glimpse
of her mastectomy bra
winter rose

low mass
the old priest believes
more than he remembers

tasting
the freckle on her cleavage
with my eyes

the same moon
shines on us both --
these cold sheets

last straw rejection --
the telemarketer tells me
I'm too old

blue sky---
my neighbor tells
another big fish story

Picking cotton—
the memory
of birdtracks in the snow

living nativity
the donkey flicks his ear
in new snowfall

ripening apples—
unable to button
my summer dress

I watch someone
watch someone else
the promise of rain

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky

summer rain --
the garden gnome's
weary smile

oh blue-haired girl
your stockings and Docs make me
a little older

tourist season
the zen garden
fills up with noise

summer clouds --
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti

meteor shower --
crickets occupied
by its song

week of rain --
the insect's trail
on the flattened leaf

yellowed envelope
holding your golden curls
spring cleaning

red poppies growing
between rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance

summer rains gone
the river
finds its own channel

election results
the muezzin's call
like a lament

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker

flooded paddies
floating rice shoots -
relentless rain

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

between cries
of neighbor's baby
symphony no. 9

a man at the beach yells---
I need oil to drive home
late June sunset

gathering dusk
all the colored pencils
back in their cup

Labor Day---
a migrant worker sells
American flags

house clearance
room by room by room
my mother disappears

fossil shells
inside a crumbling rock –
long summer rain

mother daughter
lunch
storm and thunder

under this Basholess pre-dawn sky
how rough the angle of loneliness
along this eastern sea

loud pub music
a long silence
between the flirting couple

dusk---
crescent moon amongst dark clouds
I light more candles

clear October night---
the smell
of cinnamon

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line

Wind chill minus five
the piercing whistles
of the starlings

"grabs" and "opens"
the fist
sowing seeds

broken necklace
in every scattered pearl
some sky

lifting fog
the face of an old friend
on my morning walk

steam railway
blackthorn blossom
follows the tracks

powlonia blossoms -
a haiku floating
in the sky

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

montana morning
the horses with their backs
to blowing snow

never expecting
the lilies in November
nor the small coffin

women’s day
nothing has changed
except her Facebook status

October cold wind---
her yellow skirt
rises

First days of summer . . .
already the leaves gather
beneath the sycamores

appalachian spring-
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light

cold rain
lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window

spring storm
the wind rings our
visitor's bell

ring around the moon
this uninsulated
hotel room

spring mist --
my granddaughter cries
in my arms

winter in town --
the stone memorial of the
God of Water

full moon --
last week's snow
slips from a wire

morning mist
green tips of onions
cracking the soil

August 6--
my father does not say
good morning

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors

dark early--
sepia roses
under street lights

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap . . .
this heat

finally Friday --
the dog so attentive
around the grill

New condominium
its exhaust grate claimed by
a new derelict

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound

wild poppies
gusts of music from
the midsummer fair

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono

A lull in the storm --
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.

old letter
a little silver ring
in the envelope

The way of the conch—
blueing in the sea, and
echoing in the wind

trash bag in hand—
moonlit woodlot muffles
a hound's bark

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring

New year’s day
Donkeys aflank
to sunrise

night rain--
we jump in neon puddles
and breathe rosemary

a white horse
drinks from the acequia
blossoming locust

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall

a fallen leaf
brushes the corner
of your grave stone

one by one
frogs make holes in the pond ...
starry night

rainy night
its sound keeps
the sick man company

Indian Summer --
his voice in the fall
of the leaves

half way home
pole shadows reach across
the widening road

sad words
and tears in my teacup
rainstorm

the colour of wind
through pine trees
must be blue

his scent gone
from every room
winter jasmine

croissant crumbs
I try and find
the right words

autumn deepens—
a fish slides down
the cormorant’s throat

wedding invitations
the press and release
of the nib

long night
the waterfall's
icy silence

watching the deer
watch me
morning moon

red sun
the air glitters
with dragonflies

first spring sun
the naked legs
of a window cleaner

for a moment
i am the heron
first light

motel night
alone with the moans
of winter wind

rainbow flags ...
the haunting sounds
of amazing grace

guided hike~
beyond the talk
quiet woods

window cleaner
the masks we wear
at the office

day is done
poppies amidst
the dying grass

the river—
coming to it with nothing
in my hands

in soap bubbles
again and again
his face is broken

a back road
and a flat tire . . .
the peach blossoms

figure drawing class—
in the model's deepest shadows
a stark white string

no moon
the click of stilettos
on cobblestones

from behind me
the shadow of the ticket-taker
comes down the aisle

no fireflies ...
moonlight reflects
on camellia leaves

spring evening
an old love letter
from my husband

mountain hike
we drink from the beginning
of a great river

garden wedding --
under the cherry blossoms
the bride's blush deepens

the hooker plays with herself
in her sleep
rain shimmer

sea breeze --
under full sail
a pregnant skipper

fog-shrouded coast
we listen
to the view

unemployed
but I am writing haiku
about the rain

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift

still lake—
a hawk makes off
with its image

windy night
the patient looks at
the last leaves

snow melts by the hardware counter—
the squares of color
in the paint catalog

fourth of july
a cottonwood blizzards
on the picnic

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room

overcast -
the next door pianist
hits a sour note

learning to eat
around bruises
winter apples

inhaling spring -
her new breast
two months old

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve

traffic jam
a flight of geese
across the highway

a dog’s bark
wavers in the wind
evening shadows

morning fog---
the dry cleaner says
he can't find my coat

autumn equinox
i let the last fly
go free

in the doghouse
the hound's hoarse bark—
winter thunder

riverside promenade --
seniors stroll through
falling leaves

Flashes of sunset
between the cars
the eastbound freight

spring flies
buzz above my head
E flat

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight

Easter Sunday--
my mother's bible
stuffed with obits

rain clouds
basking in the light
of an Ikea lamp

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp

cold morning---
a cockroach warms up
under my coffee cup

mid-day heat
my eyes follow
the swallow's flight

snow drifts
above the bear's den
starry night

small child
afraid to throw away
his Church Bulletin

snow flurries --
my unborn granddaughter's
heartbeat

glassy-eyed, gutted
catch of the day on shaved ice
at the fish market

full moon night...
starting the camp fire
with a page of fashion magazine

dogwood blossoms --
an ultrasound
of my newest grandson

spilled words
I arrange little magnets
looking for haiku

dusk--
songbirds' voices
disappear too

referendum day
a few pale shoots
after the frost

door slam
the rumble of thunder
louder

secure unit
a patient's cup
collecting rain

summer's end—
still a little croak left
in the bullfrog

early morning sun
scattered on the table
several grains of salt

riveredge old growth:
a towering window
of stars

silence of snow
we listen to the house
grow smaller

haiku ~
attentive to this moment
i smile

credit crunch -
a half-dozen fireworks
greet the new year

autumn visit -
over war news we talk
of babies . . .

Lights out
. . . the firefly
inside

hawk's hover -
the view of calm seas
through a gunport

flea market
a still fly is part
of the old clock

packing up house
boxes of broken dreams
filling the dumpster

winter rain --
the dog and I
exchange sighs

a famished mallard
has emigrated
to the city zoo

Summer thunderstorms---
a surfer puts his board
on his head

sunset --
the day's heat
still in the car

she speaks English
with a Provence accent---
I order a glass of rosé

shivering on the roof
I rub my palms together
meteor shower

venus in the morning sky
at the blue rain barrel
a doe stops to drink

first notes
of a busker's clarinet...
summer river

sunset---
the Empire State Building is lit
in red and yellow

spent tea leaves ~
the scent of almonds
and cinnamon

the Christmas
after we told them
artificial tree

distant horizon –
the blue line
on the pregnancy test

the last dance -
her cheap perfume
don't matter

tilted fence ~
layers of shadows
on the ivy

heart drawn in dust
by the old Indian . . .
rain

early morning---
last night stardust
is on the lilacs

maternity ward
hard looks when I shake
the gumball machine

gust
fixed on the wall
by a brush

hurricane season started---
my neighbor buys
a hybrid car

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent

spring nightfall
ink melts
over stone

no real reason
for a small sadness
late white roses

the river's calm
heat haze
lost in thought

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence

crack house
even the shadows
have shadows

father's hut -
bottle marked 'weed killer'
smelling of whisky

traffic jam -
women talk about men
in the radio

cut into his arm
a line for each day between
Christmas and New Year

english newspaper
a lot of starving people
between fish & chips

dry haystack
the muffled sound
of rain

snowflakes glued
to the kindergarten window—
no two alike

Halloween night
ghosts and goblins
watch the rain

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite

late October wind---
her blond hair flies
along with the leaves

waning moon
a faux cease-fire
in Aleppo

Chilly June morning—
in a spider web
the jailhouse fly hangs
