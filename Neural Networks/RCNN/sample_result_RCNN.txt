seaward haze--- ~ 

the first graffiti 

of their of the firework 



crescent pot - 

the old withdrawing a beach 

more leaves 



crescent travels ... 

in the lamp storm 

black all of the storm 



no gale rice 

I stranger prints sounds 

your bamboo halfway 



cold 

with the sweetness cries 

her refuses 



inhibitions 

a cloud of as 

so the landscape spring 



subway skies 

the long of shadow 

runners 



candle walk 

as the bowl rememberance 

the don't of scars 



the morn-- each 

the night’s gray cold our 

the white of the skeleton 



baby winter 

after the smile shadows 

long behind 



california 

The full him her 

under to was 



subway rain 

where lone of your 

in a yellow 



in the fourth 

of mirrors his framed 

moves to we fogging 



Uprooted night 

outside SUV sale empty 

in the market 



train sky--- 

the wake of darkness 

Robins the old 



daughter from industrial 

october too boats out half 

taped comes 



Mother’s spring 

waiting into a water 

rainfall afternoon intertwining 



East sighs 

I divorced Independence waves 

on daughter hides 



snow equinox vespers 

then comes flies topless 

fisherman traveling 



crescent boyhood 

the sound drone 

into layers 



night Spring dawn--- 

again of a ruins of tea 

shade with platform sunflowers
