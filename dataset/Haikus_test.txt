crescent moon at sunset---
she hesitates then
kisses me

early stars
the weed-choked path
to the compost

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again

afternoon heat --
bird song fades as I enter
the tunnel

mountain temple -
a prayer overgrown
with moss

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January

dust--
distant thunder
moves on

new buds
on old branches
once again

vieil étang
après la grenouille
le silence

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee

her face
in my whiisky
the moon floats

the old man
closes the shadow
in his hand

Black Friday---
so many turkeys
at the sales

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow

mountain rose—
from thorn to thorn
a spider’s line

morning stillness---
a crow finally
flies away

my train is late---
I watch a cockroach
going home

Milky Way
over a neolithic dig
the length of a breath

Wind and Sea . . .
tiny name
on the painting

summer twilight --
the instructions
for my ashes

dandelion seeds
ai r b o r n
in a cool breeze

distant thunder --
another iris opens
its petals

cut moon
each month your breast
reconstructed

her well-tanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater --
the end of summer

overcast
the first blooms
of apricot

spring fever--
shoots among the lilies
she can't name

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup

new book --
the hands of the clock move
faster

pale legs
under a white moon~
shivering aspen

dead mynah bird . . .
with each passing car
its wing flaps

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls --
the mist

come morning,
fish scales and the letter
you didn't send

all the typos
in her apology—
spring winds

Thanksgiving rain --
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

claw-hammer banjo
a veteran plants his cane
to dance

evening rain
buying cherry trees
online

mother's day
a nurse unties
the restraints

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds

autumn languor
the soft shadows
of dying roses

dogs barking
perhaps I was a cat
in other life

grandpa in his coffin
she sings a lullaby
before they close the lid

trembling
the hair ribbon falls
with inhibitions

in a backyard
two women folding sunlight
into sheets

night storm—
a deeper dark unrolls
across the prairie

arguing with my neighbor
across the fence---
a sparrow changes sides

mourning dove calls . . .
my elderly neighbor stills
the sound of her hoeing

a cooing is heard
from a small puff of feathers
another dawn

fall equinox--
a black squirrel running
on the power line

lenghtening days --
a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall

rosebuds in snow -
the softness of his hand
on my shoulder

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up

the old woman
looking into the stars
sky all snowy

the puddled field --
blades of grass
pierce a cloud

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn

applesauce
bubbles on the stove
november morning

spring thaw
everything drips
including my nose

a red cloud
on the horizon
robin's song

budget cuts --
a crescent moon
on the horizon

at the window
the drumming of rain ...
I catch up on sleep

the empty house
filled
with the rain sound

steady drizzle--
a rainbow fades
into the grey

water changing
into ice --
the pale moon

empty house
the full moon appears
at the window

from one year
to another -
the same moon

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk

nightfall --
shooting stars
on the power lines

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit

long winter night
after chapter six
the tea is cold

city lights --
the glitter
of broken glass

the new year---
a homeless man
has a new sign

winter roses
I am tired of reading
between the lines

night rain
drumming on
my mind

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table

moonrise
a woman croons
to her baby

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution

freeze warning--
the need to pee
once we hit traffic

August morning—
a window washer wiping dust
from his sunglasses

through two marriages
framed behind Beethoven
your picture

winter evening
the last dried pepper
goes into the soup

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea

moonless night
a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea

fresh autumn breeze
or the advance of age?
forgotten tea...

high summer
the slow drift
of a heron’s landing

dusk--
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam

Quiet strokes
of night swimmer: the slap
of beaver tails . . .

mon corps
three days
of cold autumn rain --

Changing the swallowtail
changed by it
the spring wind

steamed milk --
snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof

airport gate ~
the undetected poison
of your words

taking a bite
from a bitter orange
january thaw

winter solstice
the growing darkness
on death row

deep winter
the armload of firewood
chills the kitchen

the one legged bird
that deep bend before
taking off

backwaters -
i row my boat
into sunshine

empty sky
she turns love letters
into wings

moon and mist ~
night settles into silence
and white breath

spring blossoms ...
the old farmer
coughs blood

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn

jars filled with buttons
a journal
the things she left behind

the sudden chill--
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape

young girls in fog --
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco

how else to know
the shape of the breeze
dancing blossoms

a latch clicks
on the vacant house ...
winter solstice

wild Foehn
another murder
goes unsolved

dark days of winter
the dentist explains his
payment plans

from a windowless room
the ocean view
on my screensaver

scent of new leaves --
a caterpillar swings
in a shaft of light

lengthening days
I turn the Christmas lights
off

air show . . .
the ice cream girls
compare nail polish

good news
the headlines blurred
in morning rain

end of the drought --
a mushroom tilts
under the spruce

first frost---
I feed
the aquarium fish

high tide--
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves

fireside -
a son's face smiles down
from the mantelpiece

close enough to touch—
I let the junco lead me
away from its nest

new home
she promises me the world
in a lilac tree

on the path
only one of us
touched by a falling leaf

Good Friday -
cruciform a gull glides
across the sky

he feeds his fruit trees
blood and bone
...red red apples

Winter sunset---
the whistle of a
Florida bound train

tornado
in the wreckage
a bird sings

first rinse of the rice
a wild scurry
of clouds

a bright Spring day---
some graffiti
looks bigger than before

farmer's market
she paints a flower
on a child's cheek

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

overcast morning
the smell of steaming rice---
Summer

here & there
in bare treetops
mistletoe

half-moon
first day of the sales
in Oxford Street

Burial prayers
grandson playing hide and seek
behind the stones

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon

dark days
the last rose
riding wind

dusk
a lone car going the same way
as the river

severe thunderstorm warning --
a murder
of crows

damselflies
dart across the water
a bluer blue

kitchen encounter ~
tasting the wine
from his lips

high winds
a zillion elm seeds
looking for love

Sky dewed with stars
cool air listening in news
a man was hanged.

Valentine's Day
thin ice covers
the pond

gloomy day---
a blind man passes
a blooming cherry tree

crescent moon
a bone carver sings
to his ancestor

sparks
in the heat of blue
dragonflies

in the rubble
of my childhood home
wild flowers

april noon
out come the sun
and some slugs

new cracks
in an old mirror
I just noticed

up
with the chickens—
bayou sun

armistice day
a rainbow of wool drying
on the clothesline

while his passengers sleep,
the bus driver watches dawn
break

first thaw -
someone should have warned
the daffodils

humid day---
her t-shirt refuses
to dry

midnight moon...
one long howl
and then no more

wedding band --
smoke from the fireworks
dissolves against the stars

checking dividends
on the cashpoint screen
to and fro...an ant

summer sky -
between the leaves
blue butterflies

after rain--
amplified crickets
in the night

a movement of deer
into twilight
suddenly spring

another birthday
under the same
October moon

empty wine-bottle -
in the snowdrops the crushed
outline of lovers

hot and humid
the tea kettle dribbles
onto the counter

in the Yukon
sleeping with one eye shut
the summer night

chemotherapy-
she always liked the way
I kissed her hair

low tide --
a shorebird's call
rises from the mud

quick mid-winter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace

dusting off
the piano keys
autumn wind

afternoon fog---
the cat watches TV
instead of the window

schedule screen
the spider spinned its web
between two tramways ---

Thanksgiving day---
walking past
empty houses

Autumn night --
Puddles by the wayside
filling with the stars

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby ~
the sun on my teacup

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks

love again
the scent of cypress
after rain

daisies in the vase
near the bread
oven hot

december
a long shadow
joins another

sailing the seas
of my subconscious --
her fishnet stockings

trout stream -
may-flies dance
then disappear

Valentine's Day
a forsythia
without birds

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire & roses

tasting the well
in the water—
summer stars

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire

family reunion—
some of the beached kelp
in knots

rainy May Sunday---
at a bus stop
an empty can of beer

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air

mudslide
the last rain of 2005
segues into '06

too hot to shop
wasps drinking from
a town fountain

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

no word
from an ill friend—
leaves falling

starry night -
out on the highway
a truck changes gears

waiting for moonrise
the moving red dot
becomes a plane

A crow flies down
to land in the new snow
its voice ringing

first day
i divide
the kefir grains

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war

butterfly on the windshield
another journey
incomplete

morning run
observing me at the observatory
the fox

almond blossom
the stillness
after love

the tiny buds
of december roses ...
stillborn child

As if yesterday
your twenty-year-old body
wild strawberries

winter solstice
the street sweeper picks up
a glass half full

election results--
low tide clams
spit seawater

spindrift . . .
I go where
the story takes me

getting the phone -
the soft tapping
of the rocking chair

Independence Day---
an illegal immigrant
serves me a meal

friday afternoon--
just the bees
in lavender

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail
