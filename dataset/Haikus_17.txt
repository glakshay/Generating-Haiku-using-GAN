garden wedding --
under the cherry blossoms
the bride's blush deepens

In the pail full of water
under the sky of the night
reflexed moon

after its first flight
the young gerfalcon's talons
tighter on my glove

first day of school--
the house fills with the space
between second hand ticks

airport window--
the cloud of my breath
as your plane reaches the clouds

kite shop -
entering with every customer
the summer breeze

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
hereyes reflect stars

Gazing at the moon
on a still summer's evening
feast for mosquitoes

under a full moon
a homeless man gathers cans
urban harvest

Just a small basket
filled with hidden treasures
she carries proudly

a yellowed clipping
falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit

breakfast still rumbles
but no other guns are heard
Armistice morning.

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll

neither white nor black
a yellow smog that won't lift
Alzheimer's pall

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

end of summer
strands of an abandoned kite
flutter in the wind

in the hospice
an out of tune piano helps
her sing without words

sourdough smell of age
the cold rain pattering
against motel windows

her red bra
in the corner of my mind
begins to change color

therapy session:
winter rain on the window
deepens the silence

teeth in a glass
the nurse takes away his pot
of blue hyacinths

chilly tea-time --
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly

mid February
the first garden seeds display
at the hardware store

lingering cold...
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish

spring evening
under a black umbrella
phone number and key

the spider hanging in its web
doesn't care
the world is upside down

late summer -
copper wishes collect
in the bottom of the well

sudden thunderstorm-
open umbrellas flower
in many colors

lonely butterfly
in the quiet morning light
where are you going?

autumn equinox
the third quarter profits
just pay off the farm loans

in the middle of the night
silently the silence
becomes darker

among cigarette-ends
and parked cars
one yellow flower

among the magnolias
the Folia by Corelli
in a violin

Country cemetery
snail on corroded tombstone
trails from A to O...

Sky dewed with stars
cool air listening in news
a man was hanged.

foggy glasses . . .
a blurry paragraph
above the bath water

full moon night...
starting the camp fire
with a page of fashion magazine

autumn equinox -
all the crows celebrating
with grave offerings

in heavy rainfall
fluttering here and there
a white butterfly

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot

I-5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars

If you really love
America hang that flag
on a bicycle

keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old -
an amber alert!

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts

A young deer peering
at me around the hedgerow
Then, the silent leap

October daisy
bedraggled but still upright
The cold morning rain

Patient old donkey
waiting for her morning hay
Gray August sunrise

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about

sparrow song--
two ladies on the verandah
just before the rain

deer carcass
alongside the highway
silently accepts the rainstorm

Cancer clinic visit
a bald woman passes by
with a smile

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes

Lights of the ferry --
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow

Through the pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing --
Start of a sunrise

This Dark and grey day --
a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back

Rain-laden cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in

In the early morning
down on the white beach --
a turtle without eyes

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace

Light-studded ferry
passes in the starless night
another week-end

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs

picking flowers
an explosion of color
crosses the minefield

mixed rain and sleet
the hothouse rose drops
another petal

california dreaming
a white christmas
inside the snow globe

october haze
a frayed american flag
on the new pickup

wedding band --
smoke from the fireworks
dissolves against the stars

a break in the clouds
spider webs and plastic bags
catch the morning light

distant temple drums
close by the sound of a dog
shaking itself

road accident
a crowd of teddies stares out
from the shop window

ants transport a moth
traffic noise penetrates
the bamboo grove

flight of egrets
a boy stands with his ear
to a telephone pole

Gandhi's birthday
constantly relighting candles
during the peace March

First Day of Autumn---
a soccer referee pulls out
his yellow card

pigeons are flying again---
Irene downgraded
to tropical storm

Manhattan afternoon haze---
gay people no more
have to hide

dense fog---
a math teacher re-explains how
to clear parentheses

fog over the skyline---
I steam up my windows
cooking pasta

rebels retake Ajdabiya---
finally the no-fly-zone
gets teeth

coucher de soleil ---
son pull gris remonte
pour montrer son nombril

her eyes---
a hesitant dog leads
a woman into a subway car

the noise of a garbage truck
wakes me up---
December harvest moon

evening fog---
a Salvation Army soldier
rings his bell louder

East Side skyline---
the UN building looks
more like a hospital

Summer sunset---
she ties her bikini top
before she gets up

July sunset---
after a hot day
the watermelon tastes cool

morning snow---
I tell my barber do something
about my gray hairs

Saturday night rain---
a couple eye the lobsters
in a water tank

a June downpour takes a break---
I go out to buy
more water

ozone level too high---
a woman wears nothing
under her skirt

morning mist---
she takes off her eyeglasses
to see me better

afternoon dense fog---
the barmaid gives me
another for the road

East River nice day---
a used condom
on a pile of dirty snow

September Eleven---
I remember to fix
lock of my backdoor

Madison square Park---
I watch the moon
through an American Elm

the remnants
of a hurricane arrive---
and his mother-in-law

arguing with my neighbor
across the fence---
a sparrow changes sides

Independence Day---
an illegal immigrant
serves me a meal

Summer carnival---
a flat chested woman
enters the wrong rest room

on a fire hydrant
I tie my shoes---behind me
a dog waits its turn

blizzard---
too much powdered sugar
even for Valentine Day

at a general statue---
a dog salutes
by raising its leg

midwinter vanished
in a bite of homemade
strawberry preserves

rememberance service -
out of the silence
a baby's cry

above the chimneys
moon rises wearily
...another night-shift

hip replacement surgery -
on the wall
Degas' ballerinas

empty wine-bottle -
in the snowdrops the crushed
outline of lovers

cold starry night -
from the forest edge the sound
of animal kill

emptying the wine bottle -
another conversation
about Mom

a long meeting --
permanent marker
on the erasable whiteboard

New London winter --
the gleam of pleasure boats
wrapped in plastic

first of December -
police tape clinging
to a burned-out barn

morning haze --
one light rinse of the coffee cup
is good enough

after the rain
a light on in the basement
of an empty house

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic

along silk route
dancing caterpillar cocoons
in boiling water

a temple garden
snowy path to bronze bell
having deep footprints

wiping the full moon
from a wet glossy table
with my bare hand

efficiency seminar
a reek of cheap fat
lingers in the hall

nothing more tiring
than being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee

beyond darkened fields,
growing with bird-song
- this tide-line of dawn

distant thunder--
I dream I've forgotten
where my parents live

honking through the darkness
long before their shapes:
the twilight geese

New-York September
the one-way sign points towards
the billowing cloud

carousel music ?
i still see my brother
on the painted pony

the damp stain on the wall
only looks like a damp stain -
Monday morning

cloudy skies -
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd

the boat crests a wave -
tracing my finger around
an ancient stone

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time-
fireflies

shoots of green grain-
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway

dirtballs, dust and clay
through autumn's dusk
the computer wanes and hums

oh moon, moon
above so much powdery snow
father is still ill

ursa major
a plane's navigation lights
leave the system

the moon is broken
Battersea Power Station
from a train window

half the village burning
while my son makes popcorn
bare trees

dark lamp shade--
squinting her eyes in low light
to read your letter

migratory pelicans...
the pollster presses
for an opinion

autumn melancholy
the click of mahjong tiles
from the computer

even the memory
of winter is melted . . .
blazing summer day

examinations ...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves

deepening snow--
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

winter in the wind
no cake for this candle lit
in memoriam

overnight rain --
the scent of orange blossoms
in a desert town

All through the meeting, 
your calm face by the window.
Bright, darkening trees

first day of fall 
a train takes the hound's howl
deeper into the night

jasmine beyond
the honeycombed lattice
a call to prayer

distant thunder—
a titmouse gives one chirp
and falls silent

shivering on the roof
I rub my palms together
meteor shower

autumn evening . . .
a page of the old book
separates from the spine

autumn evening
my hospital window
becomes a mirror

that Venus!
leading the cupped moon
through every turn of the road

August morning—
a window washer wiping dust
from his sunglasses

ten below zero:
man and boy walk through their breath
to read old tombstones

under the back steps
catfish still flop in the pail—
the long August night

early April rain
that woman fills every jar,
seals them forever

crossing the bright sky
of a near-sighted swimmer,
the song of a bird

apples cooking:
in the aroma
pictures of my mother canning

from behind me
the shadow of the ticket-taker
comes down the aisle

Part of a dog
walking by upside down
in the roadside puddle

never expecting
the lilies in November
nor the small coffin

the white v of a killdeer’s wings
opening in the wake
of its cry

music on the wind
an amish foot softly taps
and abruptly stops

the old watering can
hangs one more rainbow
among the roses

quiet afternoon—
in the meadow, one daisy
leans on another

chilly sunrise
a strip of bark flutters
on the lake-side birch

First spring day
melting and melting and melting
tracks of the mountain man.

abandoned farmhouse
bird nest in the mail box
also deserted

abandoned farmhouse: a
moth flies out of the water
faucet

the slow day ...
in the empty motel corridor
a stack of dirty dishes

wrestling on the edge
of the State Fisheries tank
—two soaked monkeys

past the plane's great wing
a strip of thin grass shimmers
in the jet wind

Frog Mountain rises
to arch its back in the clouds:
unforeseen downpour.

Three men and three birds
stand still in the forest, all
surprised by rain.

Uprooted clouds:
Summer holds the pale mountains,
calls down the clear night.

The sun slips low
a carnelian red paving
the water with dark light

In the shadow of
office buildings, bagpiper's
Amazing Grace

Last night’s fading dream …
On the blue teapot birds drift
beyond the willows

Under cloudless skies;
nuclear resister jailed
missiles free to fly

Little ladybug
caught after visiting hours:
doing jail time, too

Chilly June morning—
in a spider web
the jailhouse fly hangs

summer afternoon—
the priest takes a blue pencil
from the blind man
