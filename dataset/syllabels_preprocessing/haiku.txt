Caruso recording - + the gramophone crackle + lights the fires in his eye
crescent moon over the skyline--- + she shows lots + of cleavage
the evening paper + on the darkening lawn— + first star
night pool - + fish rise + to crumbs of stars
evening traffic - + caught in a low moon + the heron's flight
